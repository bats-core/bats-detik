# Basic examples
verify "there are 1 service named 'nginx'"
verify "there are 4 pods named 'nginx'"

# The same thing (it is case insensitive)
verify "There are 4 pods naMed 'nginx'"

# Use short names for resources ('po' instead of 'pods')
# See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#resource-types
verify "there are 4 po named 'nginx'"

# Use a regular expression for the name
verify "there are 4 po named 'nginx.*'"

# Verifying properties
#########################################

# Basic example
verify "'status' is 'running' for pods named 'nginx'"

verify "'status' is 'running' for po named 'nginx'"

# Use a regular expression for the name
verify "'status' is 'running' for pods named 'nginx.*'"

# You can also use column names
# Use kubectl get <resource> -o custom-columns=ALL:* to find column names.
