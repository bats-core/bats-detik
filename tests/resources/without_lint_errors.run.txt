# Basic examples
run verify "there are 1 service named 'nginx'"
run verify "there are 4 pods named 'nginx'"

# The same thing (it is case insensitive)
run verify "There are 4 pods naMed 'nginx'"

# Use short names for resources ('po' instead of 'pods')
# See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#resource-types
run verify "there are 4 po named 'nginx'"

# Use a regular expression for the name
run verify "there are 4 po named 'nginx.*'"

# Verifying properties
#########################################

# Basic example
run verify "'status' is 'running' for pods named 'nginx'"
	run verify "'status' is 'running' for pods named 'nginx'"

# The same thing (it is case insensitive)
run verify "'status' is 'RUNNING' for pods naMed 'nginx'"

# Use short names for resources ('po' instead of 'pods')
# See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#resource-types
run verify "'status' is 'running' for po named 'nginx'"

# Use a regular expression for the name
run verify "'status' is 'running' for pods named 'nginx.*'"

# You can also use column names
# Use kubectl get <resource> -o custom-columns=ALL:* to find column names.

#########################################

# Basic example

# See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#resource-types
run try "at most 5 times every 5s to get po named 'nginx' and verify that 'status' is 'running'"

# Use a regular expression for the name
run try "at most 2 times every 30s to get po named '^ng.*nx' and verify that 'status' is 'running'"

# You can also use column names
# Use kubectl get <resource> -o custom-columns=ALL:* to find column names.
